## Analysis of Insertion Sort algorithm:
- Insertion sort requires comparing and shifting elements which would require nested loops.
- In the instance above, this would mean insertion sort would take quadratic time O(n^2) as average and worst case.
- The best case for insertion sort would be that the elements are already sorted which would take linear time O(n)

## Analysis of Matrix Multiplication algorithm:
- Matrix Multiplication algorithm requires iterating through each row of one matrix and before the next iteration, all three columns of the second matrix would have to be iterated through. This would require three nested for loops which is present in the algorithm provided.
- In the instance above, this algorithm would take cubic time O(n^3) as best, worst, and average case.
