## Approach used to solve:
-  In order to solve this problem, I initially had to draw out a binary tree to know exactly where I'm traversing and what I'm comparing. Once I got that done, things made a lot more sense and was a bit easier to code. First, I checked if the root is null and had it return the root if it does satisfy it. I also used an if-statement to check whether the search has reached p or q and returned it. After that, I created a TreeNode object left and right to represent the recursive function. If the left is null, search right and if the right is null, search left.
