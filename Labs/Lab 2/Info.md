## Approach used to solve:
For this lab, what I did was convert input strings 's' and 't' to lowercase (in case of inputs where there are uppercase characters), turned them into an array of characters, and used the Arrays class to sort the arrays. Next, I used an if statement to compare the two and return true if they are anagrams of each other, otherwise, return false.
